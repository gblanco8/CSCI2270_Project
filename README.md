# To Do List
  - Dummy Proof EVERYTHING!!!
  - Finish the code to write to the text file
  - deleteProfile option (?)
    -- deletes every task and category that the profile contains
  - addProfile needs to check whether the profile already exists before adding a new profile
  - addTask needs to also call on the profile name before adding task so it doesn't create a task for the wrong profile
